Proof of concept for SEEDCARD verification

1. Cardholder taps SEEDCARD with NFC enabled phone to verify card.

2. Card NFC tag is programmed with redirect URL - example https://seedcard.github.io/nfcverificationpoc/?blockchair=https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qxjyjs76d9ltthursnkl82swjlg0vc70j7lz5jr&uid=SC0464A2CA9C1790&qr=https://i.ibb.co/YjdG85q/qr-code-47.png
   
3. Card holder clicks ENTER button to access SEEDCARD:
   
- Card ID - unique ID (UID) of NFC tag which is also engraved on the SEEDCARD plate
 
- Card Balance - link to Blockchair bitcoin explorer to confirm balance and current value in USD

- Top up Card - use or share public key qr code to add funds to the SEEDCARD
